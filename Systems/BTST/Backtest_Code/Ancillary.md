Along with Backtest Codes, there are a few Ancillary codes that form a part of the main Backtest Codes. These codes need to be updated from time to time:

1) **IncludeOK Code : -**
   This code is basically all the F&O Stocks that are / were a part of the F&O List along with their respective dates. This list is updated regularly.
   The spreadsheet where the code is can be found here E:\Dropboximac\Dropbox\Database Maintenance\FO Equity Daily on the E : Drive. 
   [F&O Includeok](https://github.com/qodeinvestments/AncillaryCodes/blob/056357250ada3e7e1c65ed41642ab2b6baf7a5b3/F&O%20IncludeOK)
   
2) **BanList Code : -**
   On a day to day basis , NSE issues a BanList where some stocks in the F&O List cannot be traded on that particular day. This code is also regularly updated.
   The spreadsheet which contains the BanList code can be found here E:\Dropboximac\Dropbox\Database Maintenance\Ban List on the E : Drive.
   [F&O BanList](https://github.com/qodeinvestments/AncillaryCodes/blob/056357250ada3e7e1c65ed41642ab2b6baf7a5b3/F&O%20BanList)
   
3) **Expiry Selection Code: -**
   For BTST one day prior to expiry, we open next month contracts. Those symbols will be called "FUT1" as oppposed to the current month symbols 
   which are called "FUT". 
   [F&O Expiry Selection](https://github.com/qodeinvestments/AncillaryCodes/blob/056357250ada3e7e1c65ed41642ab2b6baf7a5b3/F&O%20Expiry%20Selection)
