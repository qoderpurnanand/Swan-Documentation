The python file here is used to clean & filter the Initial data we got from exploration.

We have filtered the following conditions :

1. Kept companies which have data in 2 or more years.
2. Removed all the indexes from the data.
3. Kept companies from 2004 onwards only to analyse their data from previous years (2001-2003).

the final DataFrame is then exported, named as : "Final_Universe.csv" and used in futher files.
